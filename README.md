# New-Year-Resolution-Tweets
## Introduction
This project is all about New Year Resolution tweets in United state for the year 2015. It is just to test how our journey in learning Data Analysis is going with some of my reading mates and friends. The Dataset is cleaned, analysed and visualized in Microsoft Excel. The problem statement is an imaginary problem that we can up after looking at the dataset.

## Problem Statement
- What is the most popular resolution category and the least popular category?
- Which resolution category was retweeted the most and the least resolution category?
- Using the tweet created field, and rounding to the nearest hour, what was the most popular hour of day to tweet?
- Which state has the highest number of tweets?
- Which gender tweet the most?
- Using map to visualize which US state teweeted the highest number of NYE resolutions?
So, i will be using the dataset to answer the above mentioned problems. The dataset contains 4723 rows and 10 columns, the headers of the dataset are Tweeet created, tweet text, tweet categories, tweet topics, tweet location, tweet state, tweet region, user timezone, user gender and retweet count.
