# New-Year-Resolution-Tweets
## Introduction
This project is all about New Year Resolution tweets in United state for the year 2015. It is just to test how our journey in learning Data Analysis is going with some of my reading mates and friends. The Dataset is cleaned, analysed and visualized in Microsoft Excel. The problem statement is an imaginary problem that we can up after looking at the dataset.

## Problem Statement
- What is the most popular resolution category and the least popular category?
- Which resolution category was retweeted the most and the least resolution category?
- Using the tweet created field, and rounding to the nearest hour, what was the most popular hour of day to tweet?
